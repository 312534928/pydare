Description: This small package contains two Python routines for solving the
        discrete-time Riccati Equation (DARE) and the discrete-time
        Lyapunov Equation.  These routines were developed in support
        of a controls-related research project.  Both solvers were
        developed into a minimally functional set of routines to 
        satisfy the project for which they were originally meant. 
        However, this functionality may be sufficient for other users
        as well.  Note that the pydare package does not include 
        routines for solving continuous versions of these two equation
        sets.
